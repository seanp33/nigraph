1. install igraph per http://igraph.org/c/doc/
2. install node-gyp `npm install -g node-gyp`

node-gyp rebuild

# and to compile the the igraph smoke
`gcc igraph_smoke.c -I/usr/local/include/igraph -L/usr/local/lib -ligraph -o igraph_smoke`
... of if those -I -L paths are incorrect, learn wherre they are on your system with `pkg-config --libs --cflags igraph`
